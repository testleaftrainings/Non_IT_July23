OOPs:
Object oriented programming language
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming , that focuses on designing and organizing code based on the concept of "objects." 
1.flexibility
2.maintain 
3.reuse

---->Inheritance
---->Polymorphism

---->Encapsulation

Inheritance:
------------
inherit the property (variable/method) from one class to another
1.Reusability of code
2.memory management
keyword-extends
Base/super/parent class
derived/subclass/child class
types:
single inheritance
Multilevel inheritance
Multiple inheritance-Not support in java class but we can achieve by interface


Polymorphism:
--------------
Poly -many      morphism-forms
mobile-call
      -TextMsg
	  -video
Type:
Overloading-static polymorphism/compile-time polymorphism
same method name/different arg /diff data type
frame(int index)
frame(String id/name)
frame(Webelement)

java
-----
substring(start index)
substring(start,stop index)

Dynamic polymorphism/Run-time polymorphism
overriding-same method name,same arg,same data type but different class

2.Abstraction:
Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class or object
and exposing only the essential features or behavior to the outside world. 
achieve abstraction through abstract classes and interfaces:

Abstract Class: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is typically used as a base class for other classes. 
It may contain both abstract and concrete (implemented) methods.
An abstract method is a method without any implementation, declared using the abstract keyword.

Interface: An interface is a collection of abstract methods that define a 
contract for classes implementing the interface. 
It provides a way to achieve multiple inheritance in Java. 
Interfaces are declared using the interface keyword, and all methods in an interface are implicitly abstract and public.
To show the necessary things to the user and hide the details.

variable methods create obj

interface extends interface
class to interface implement
